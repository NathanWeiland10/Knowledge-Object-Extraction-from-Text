docs = ["""Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that
         maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a
         function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.
         In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object
         (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). 
         A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, 
         which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the 
         algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires 
         the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a 
         'reasonable' way (see inductive bias).""", 
             
        """Keywords are defined as phrases that capture the main topics discussed in a document. 
        As they offer a brief yet precise summary of document content, they can be utilized for various applications. 
        In an information retrieval environment, they serve as an indication of document relevance for users, as the list 
        of keywords can quickly help to determine whether a given document is relevant to their interest. 
        As keywords reflect a document's main topics, they can be utilized to classify documents into groups 
        by measuring the overlap between the keywords assigned to them. Keywords are also used proactively 
        in information retrieval."""]
