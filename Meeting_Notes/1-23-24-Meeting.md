# 1-23-24 Meeting
## Time
* 6:00pm - 7:00pm
## Location
* Online (Discord)
## Team Members Present
* Janki
* Matthew
* Nathan
* Tiffany
* Uvie
## Decisions Made
* For creating the preliminary schedule, we will combine the schedules created by Uvie and Janki into a single document
  * Janki's schedule includes specifics about technical aspects of developing the project, so we will use this schedule for our project milestones
  * Uvie's schedule is more generalized and includes non-technical aspects, such as meetings with out client, so we will use this schedule for our basic schedule
* We will include the project requirements in our preliminary schedule since it correlates with our milestones
* For easier viewing, we will include a Gantt Chart in our preliminary schedule based on our basic schedule
* We will not assign specific team members in our basic schedule since our work breakdown will become more clear as the project progresses
* Our preliminary schedule document will be completed before 2:00pm tomorrow so we will have time to print it before the start of class
## Other Discussions
* Future Idea: For the first tool, allow the user to choose their domain or KO before importing the document
