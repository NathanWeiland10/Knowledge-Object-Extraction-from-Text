## Matador Project Overview
* **Client:** Jeremy Whiteman, Aerospace Engineer at Wright-Patterson AFB
* **Objective:** Create a tool that allows relevant information to be extracted, labeled, and given a likelihood/confidence score by the user for use of knowledge graphs. This data should then be merged together to form data that can be used knowledge graphs:
  * **1st Tool:** Used for importing documents, labeling, and exporting data (including the original article or document and metadata) in a valid format, such as XML, CSV, or [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/). The focus should be making the view user-friendly, similar to [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)
  * **2nd Tool:** Stitch together data into a object with a tree structure that is ingestible by a knowledge graph and evaluate likelihood/confidence scores for subtrees given user-supplied information. Allow for keyword filtering and searching. The focus should be on tokenizing this data to be ingestible by a knowledge graph
* **Notes:** There is a primary focus on *user-friendly design*; the 1st Tool should have a intuitive design that allows the user to highlight, label, and classify important information into a category (such as a measure, quote, etc.) as well as be given a likelihood/confidence score supplied by the user. The 2nd Tool should primarily focus on creating a knowledge graph object, however, the user should still have search capabilities in the 2nd Tool. The use case for this project is primarily for thesis research and investigative journalism.
