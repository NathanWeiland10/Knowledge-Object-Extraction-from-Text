# 2-14-24 Meeting
## Time
* 7:45pm - 8:15pm
## Location
* Online (Discord)
## Team Members Present
* Matthew
* Nathan
* Tiffany
* Jeremy
## Decisions Made
* Our project does not need to be separated into two separate programs - if it can be implemented in a single program, that is okay
* No database or integrated backend is required for our MVP, but can be implemented if time allows
* Focus should be placed on user friendliness and intuitiveness, similar to Mendeley. AI aspects can be implemented later if time allows
    * User should highlight their own sections
## Other Discussions
* Users may have trust issues regarding AI, especially in the case where data is only labeled by AI and machine learning with no user interference
* Jeremy is familiar with Python and would be able to fit our project into his workflow easier if our project uses Python, however, we should choose whichever language or technology that we are most comfortable with
