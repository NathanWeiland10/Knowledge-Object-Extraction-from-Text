## Decisions Made
* Since we have decided on our tech stack (Bootstrap: HTML and CSS), we can begin dividing up tasks to prepare for our demo on Wednesday, March 20th
* It may be beneficial for some team members to focus on coding while other team members focus on the presentation and use cases
* Possible tasks:
   1) Extracting metadata and annotations in a JSON format
   2) Presentation for demo
   3) Integration of UI with 'backend' (extracting metadata and annotations)
   4) Use cases and documentation
   5) Finishing UI (using Figma our Figma document as a guide)
* No final decisions have been made yet for assigning tasks - these are only ideas of ways we can split up the work
